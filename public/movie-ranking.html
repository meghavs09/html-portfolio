<h1>The Best K Dramas According to Megha</h1>

<h2>My top 3 K drams of all the time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>StartUp</h3>
<p>Such an inspirational drama. Love the every bit of it. I don't see many such movies/dramas anywhere. I have had second lead syndrome for a very long time after whatching this drama(I guess even now I have it)</p>

<h3>What's Wrong With Secretry Kim</h3>
<p>Its just sooo funny. I loved the chemistry between the couple. Overall very good watch. </p>

<h3>Summer strike</h3>
<p>Recently watched this drama. This is so much satisfying. I could relate so much to it. Worth all of the time I spent watching this one. </p>
